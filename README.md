## Description

Socailly is a social media API created with Express.js and MongooseDB is a backend application programming interface that leverages the Express.js framework for building social media platforms or integrating social media features into applications. It utilizes MongooseDB, a MongoDB object modeling tool, for seamless interaction with the database.

The API handles user creation, getter, updation and deletion. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. User data, such as username, email, and password, is stored in the MongoDB database using Mongoose schemas. Also, user can have thoughts and other users can have reaction upon on the thought.
